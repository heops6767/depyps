## 📚 About the Project

This project explores the mechanics of HTTP flood attacks using a user-friendly web dashboard. Built on top of the **[Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)**, it allows you to control the "stress test" parameters directly from your browser.

**Features (Experimental):**
* **Web Dashboard:** Start/Stop attacks with one click.
* **Thread Control:** Adjust the intensity of the "testing".
* **Real-time Feedback:** Simple logs of sent packets.

## 🤡 The "Stats" Reality Check

While this is labeled as a "DoS tool," let’s look at the actual statistics:

* **Global Servers Downed:** 0
* **Personal Routers Crashed:** 42
* **Laptops Overheated:** High
* **Localhost Crashed:** 100% of the time

**The Joke:** Since this is written in Python, you aren't really launching a cyber-war. You are essentially trying to put out a forest fire by spitting on it. In most cases, your own computer will run out of RAM and "DoS" itself before the target even notices a single extra request. **It’s the world's most complicated space heater.** 🔥
